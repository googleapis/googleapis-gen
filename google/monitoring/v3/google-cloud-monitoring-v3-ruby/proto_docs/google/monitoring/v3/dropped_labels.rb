        # A set of (label, value) pairs which were dropped during aggregation, attached
        # to google.api.Distribution.Exemplars in google.api.Distribution values during
        # aggregation.
        #
        # These values are used in combination with the label values that remain on the
        # aggregated Distribution timeseries to construct the full label set for the
        # exemplar values.  The resulting full label set may be used to identify the
        # specific task/job/instance (for example) which may be contributing to a
        # long-tail, while allowing the storage savings of only storing aggregated
        # distribution values for a large group.
        #
        # Note that there are no guarantees on ordering of the labels from
        # exemplar-to-exemplar and from distribution-to-distribution in the same
        # stream, and there may be duplicates.  It is up to clients to resolve any
        # ambiguities.
