class BotsGrpcTransport(BotsTransport):
    """gRPC backend transport for Bots.

    Design doc: https://goo.gl/oojM5H

    Loosely speaking, the Bots interface monitors a collection of
    workers (think of them as "computers" for a moment). This collection
    is known as a "farm," and its purpose is to perform work on behalf
    of a client.

    Each worker runs a small program known as a "bot" that allows it to
    be controlled by the server. This interface contains only methods
    that are called by the bots themselves; admin functionality is out
    of scope for this interface.

    More precisely, we use the term "worker" to refer to the physical
    "thing" running the bot. We use the term "worker," and not "machine"
    or "computer," since a worker may consist of more than one machine -
    e.g., a computer with multiple attached devices, or even a cluster
    of computers, with only one of them running the bot. Conversely, a
    single machine may host several bots, in which case each bot has a
    "worker" corresponding to the slice of the machine being managed by
    that bot.

    The main resource in the Bots interface is not, surprisingly, a Bot
    - it is a BotSession, which represents a period of time in which a
    bot is in continuous contact with the server (see the BotSession
    message for more information). The parent of a bot session can be
    thought of as an instance of a farm. That is, one endpoint may be
    able to manage many farms for many users. For example, for a farm
    managed through GCP, the parent resource will typically take the
    form "projects/{project_id}". This is referred to below as "the farm
    resource."

    This class defines the same methods as the primary client, so the
    primary client can load the underlying transport implementation
    and call it.

    It sends protocol buffers over the wire using gRPC (which is built on
    top of HTTP/2); the ``grpcio`` package must be installed.
