/**
 * A software recipe is a set of instructions for installing and configuring a
 * piece of software. It consists of a set of artifacts that are
 * downloaded, and a set of steps that install, configure, and/or update the
 * software.
 * Recipes support installing and updating software from artifacts in the
 * following formats:
 * Zip archive, Tar archive, Windows MSI, Debian package, and RPM package.
 * Additionally, recipes support executing a script (either defined in a file or
 * directly in this api) in bash, sh, cmd, and powershell.
 * Updating a software recipe
 * If a recipe is assigned to an instance and there is a recipe with the same
 * name but a lower version already installed and the assigned state
 * of the recipe is `INSTALLED_KEEP_UPDATED`, then the recipe is updated to
 * the new version.
 * Script Working Directories
 * Each script or execution step is run in its own temporary directory which
 * is deleted after completing the step.
