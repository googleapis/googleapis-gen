        # The Scanner service of the On-Demand Scanning API.
        #
        # This service provides a way to find vulnerabilities for the packages in some
        # container image. A user provides a a list of packages to `AnalyzePackages`
        # and receives a list of vulnerabilities in return. The `AnalyzePackages`
        # method is asynchronous, implementing Long-running Operations to track
        # progress.
        #
        # To load this service and instantiate a client:

        #     require "google/cloud/on_demand_scanning/v1/scanner_service"
        #     client = ::Google::Cloud::OnDemandScanning::V1::ScannerService::Client.new
