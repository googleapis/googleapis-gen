          # Specification of the Firestore API.
          #
          # The Cloud Firestore service.
          #
          # This service exposes several types of comparable timestamps:
          #
          # *    `create_time` - The time at which a document was created. Changes only
          #      when a document is deleted, then re-created. Increases in a strict
          #       monotonic fashion.
          # *    `update_time` - The time at which a document was last updated. Changes
          #      every time a document is modified. Does not change when a write results
          #      in no modifications. Increases in a strict monotonic fashion.
          # *    `read_time` - The time at which a particular state was observed. Used
          #      to denote a consistent snapshot of the database or the time at which a
          #      Document was observed to not exist.
          # *    `commit_time` - The time at which the writes in a transaction were
          #      committed. Any read with an equal or greater `read_time` is guaranteed
          #      to see the effects of the transaction.
